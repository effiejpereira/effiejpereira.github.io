My [new paper](https://content.apa.org/record/2017-34547-001) on social attention just got through the final publishing hurdle and is now out for public consumption! Really proud of the novel methods we used here to show that social reward through praise and positive feedback biases our spatial attention, demonstrating that complex social signals can directly influence our cognition and behaviour.

Highly thankful to our Action Editor for really pushing us to use some complex statistical analyses for our paper. Though it's easy to stick to tried-and-true methods, this process made me revisit some of my old favourite stats textbooks from Jacob Cohen and really helped me learn a slew of new techniques from the Bayesian world.
