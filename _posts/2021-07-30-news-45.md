Excited to see McGill University's Bicentennial website up and running, along with my graphic design work for the [Faculty of Science timeline](https://200.mcgill.ca/faculties/faculty-of-science/). It was a lot of fun rooting through the photo archives and finding out more about the history of science at my alma mater and great to see everyone's hard work at its end goal.
