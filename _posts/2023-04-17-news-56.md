Now that the ink is officially dry, I'm beyond thrilled to announce that I'll be returning to my alma mater Queen's University as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/) in January 2024!

Kingston definitely became a second home to me after I left Dubai in 2004, and I'm feeling incredibly thankful that my academic journey has brought me, Josh, & little Loki back to where we started. I'm very much looking forward to reuniting with old friends, getting to know new colleagues, and building a diverse group to study attention in all of its tempporal, functional, and computational glory!

Grateful to all of my mentors who helped me get here – Dan Smilek, Sylvain Baillet, Jelena Ristic, Debra Titone, and Monica Castelhano – and to the amazingly talented undergraduate and graduate students that I've worked with over the years – I owe you all some delicious Kingston churros in the future!
