Michael Richardson and Paula Silva. I could not recommend this workshop highly enough! Between recurrence quantification analyses and cross and joint domains, this analytical toolset has really broadened my statistical perspective and made me think outside-the-box on how I can examine temporal effects across all my dependent measures, from accuracy to RT to eye tracking to EEG. Can't wait to get started on my own data analysis here!<br><br>"
