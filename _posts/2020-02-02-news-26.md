In this monthly feature, I interview graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in our department and craft profiles on them and the work that they do.

This project took a bit of a backseat given my dissertation writing these past few months, but I'm thrilled to relaunch the [Spotlight Series feature](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/graduate/spotlight) for the McGill Psychology Department this month! In this monthly feature, I interview graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in our department and craft profiles on them and the work that they do. It's been amazingly fun flexing my writing skills and crafting work for a more general audience, and I'm excited for everyone to read some of the features we have coming up over the next few months!
