Goodness, it was quite the surprise opening up my email and seeing my picture promoting the [Virtual Healthy Brain for Healthy Lives Research Day](https://www.mcgill.ca/hbhl/events/research-day/research-day-2020) this year! I had a great time giving my talk at last year's Research Day and can't wait to see their line-up again this year!
