As part of a reflection on the Black Lives Matter movement and our collective and ongoing fight against institutionalized and structural Anti-Black racism, the McGill Psychology Department allowed me to use the June edition of our [Spotlight Series](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/article/impact-communicating-norms) to interview researchers in the department who specialize in how individuals perceive and evaluate one another across group boundaries. It was great to talk to faculty member [Dr. Eric Hehman](http://erichehman.com/) and Vanier Scholar [Eugene Ofosu](https://twitter.com/ofosueugene) about the impact of communicating norms at individual, group, and institutional levels, and to contribute to the conversation on how to be an ally for historically excluded groups.
