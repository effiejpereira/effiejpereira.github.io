More exciting research news for the start of the year since [Chapter 4 of my dissertation](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-43240-001) is officially out in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception & Performance. This was the final chapter from my dissertation left to be published and I'm really proud of this beast of a study that incorporated 6 separate experiments covering behavioural, eye tracking, and bayesian analyses!

My findings are also really captivating because this work shows that spontaneous attentional biasing to faces is biased by the external content factor of perceived facial attractiveness, and not other content factors like global luminance or featural configuration, demonstrating that attractiveness in faces is rather critical in eliciting these effects. My findings also further highlight the utility of reconceptualizing attention as an integrative system that can be influenced and controlled by not just stimulus factors and task information, but also internal preferences and personal experiences.
