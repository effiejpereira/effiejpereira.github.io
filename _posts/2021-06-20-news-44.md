Had a great time presenting virtually at [CSBBCS](https://www.csbbcs.org/meetings/2021-meeting) this year, and debuting some of the new recurrence methods I've been able to apply to my mind wandering data. Though I definitely miss the in-person component of these conferences, I loved the platform the CSBBCS execs decided to use this year, and the graduate committee also put together some wonderful social get-togethers on GatherTown. Phenomenal job all around!
