excerpt: "Had an incredible time at BrainCamp with the <a href='https://sicn.cmb.ucdavis.edu/' target='_blank'>Kavli Summer Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience</a> in Santa Barbara, California these past two weeks. Between meeting new colleagues from all around the world, talking to world-renowned scholars, dissecting a human brain, and learning new methodologies to expand my own work in attention, this experience was completely beyond what any academic and researcher could ever hope. Grateful for my time there and excited to put my new skills to use!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2015_06_SICN.jpg'><br><br>"

Had an incredible time at BrainCamp with the [Kavli Summer Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience](https://sicn.cmb.ucdavis.edu/) in Santa Barbara, California these past two weeks. Between meeting new colleagues from all around the world, talking to world-renowned scholars, dissecting a human brain, and learning new methodologies to expand my own work in attention, this experience was completely beyond what any academic and researcher could ever hope. Grateful for my time there and excited to put my new skills to use!
