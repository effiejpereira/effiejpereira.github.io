This has been a pet project of mine for about a year now since there are many inspiring stories out there on the unsung graduates in our department, and I'm happy to shine some light on them and their work. For the first article in this series, I sat down with PhD candidate Kristin Horsley to talk to her about her work with Universities Canada and Cossette Health to advocate for interdisciplinary research in Canada. Funding for the sciences is so vital to move us forward as a society and it was great chatting to her about the amazing work she's doing in this area.<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2018_01_spotlight.jpg'><br><br>"
