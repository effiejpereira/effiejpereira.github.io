Though most have been busy with sourdough starters this week, I had tons of fun solving _The Miracle Sudoku_ from Cracking the Cryptic crew! [Simon Anthony's turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4&feature=youtu.be) at it was way more spellbinding than my own, but I'd highly recommend giving it a go if you'd like to spend an afternoon playing with numbers!
