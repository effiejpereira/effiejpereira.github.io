Beyond thrilled to announce that I was awarded the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship for 2022-2024! Although I was officially told about the results back in February, the announcement of the award has been under wraps until all the paperwork could be settled and I finally get to scream it out into the void now!

It's hard to put into words what an award like this means to me – as an academic, the validation of my work is incredible; as a first-generation scholar, the access to resources is immense; and as someone who had never really seen herself represented anywhere in science, the ability to be in such a significant position for my students and others in the field makes me a bit speechless. Although I put a lot of hard work and time and effort into the application, I'm also incredibly thankful to all of my many mentors and advisors who supported me in getting here. I owe you all many bagels and cupcakes!
