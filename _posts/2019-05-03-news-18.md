I had a great time at the [Healthy Brain for Healthy Lives Research Day](https://www.mcgill.ca/hbhl/events/research-day) learning about the amazing work we're doing on delivering implementable and clinically effective outcomes for brain health. I'm also honoured that my talk _Within-individual oscillatory patterns in mind wandering and attentive states are associated with functional life outcomes_ was selected as the Best Oral Presentation of the day!
