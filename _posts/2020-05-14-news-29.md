A big thank you to Dr. Laura Mickes for covering my latest publication with Dr. Monica Castelhano on the [Psychonomics Society Featured Content section](https://featuredcontent.psychonomic.org/sensory-information-goals-and-prior-knowledge-come-together-to-capture-attention/). Our study focused on how attention is distributed within real-world environments by examining the degree to which our attention can be biased by other objects either within or outside our area of focus. I was really proud of this work since we were able to come up with completely new variables that captured both early and late stages of attentional biasing, meaning I got to play around with some really fun graphing techniques!

This is the first of our three part series on the Surface Guidance Framework, so look for more on this work soon!
