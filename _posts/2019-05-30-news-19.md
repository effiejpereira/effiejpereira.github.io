[Chapter 2 of my dissertation](https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5150/3/2/29) is currently out in the open access journal Vision! In this chapter, I further probed what factors may be responsible in preferential and spontaneous attentional biasing towards faces and eyes, and investigated visual context through background scene information. It seems like seeing faces in embedded environments does in fact enhance more overt measures of social attentional biasing (i.e., when eyes are free to move).

We also found interesting dissociations between directly looking at faces with our eyes and covertly attending to them with our _mind's eye_, indicating that we use these two processes very differently in our own social lives. That is, directly looking at faces and people may be used to explicitly convey our own internal thoughts and emotions to others, whereas covertly attending to them may be used to discreetly gather information around us without revealing our immediate intentions to others.
