Officially defended my PhD thesis today, and surprisingly, it was a really great and fun experience! A big thank you to my defense committee members for all of their thoughtful comments and questions and for sticking around late on a Friday afternoon! Though I'm sure I'll feel quite reflective of my closing chapter at McGill over the next few days, I'm also incredibly stoked to get started with my post-PhD life at the University of Waterloo!
