excerpt: "It's always a great time attending <a href='http://www.opam.net/' target='_blank'>OPAM</a> and <a href='https://www.psychonomic.org/page/meetings' target='_blank'>Psychonomics</a> every November, and I loved presenting my latest fMRI work looking at the relationship between the default network of our brain and the content of what we mind wander to. fMRI is certainly a whole new beast in terms of pre-processing and data analyses, though I was excited to wade through it all with my expert colleague and former thesis student, Lauri Gurguryan. We're hoping to delve into some graph theory for the second stage of our analyses and I'll ideally have more conference updates from this project in the new year!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2019_11_OPAM.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2019_11_PS.jpg'><br><br>"

It's always a great time attending [OPAM](http://www.opam.net/) and [Psychonomics](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/meetings) every November, and I loved presenting my latest fMRI work looking at the relationship between the default network of our brain and the content of what we mind wander to. fMRI is certainly a whole new beast in terms of pre-processing and data analyses, though I was excited to wade through it all with my expert colleague and former thesis student, Lauri Gurguryan. We're hoping to delve into some graph theory for the second stage of our analyses and I'll ideally have more conference updates from this project in the new year!
