Thrilled that I had a chance to chat with the Faculty of Arts about my [Banting award](https://uwaterloo.ca/arts/news/banting-postdoctoral-fellowship-announced) for my research program on the temporal dynamics of internal attention. A big thanks to the University of Waterloo for their support and feedback throughout the process, and major shoutouts to my alma maters McGill University and Queen's University for pushing my curiosity in new directions!
