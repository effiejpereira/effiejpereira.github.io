I'm always excited to launch the yearly issue of the [McGill Psychology Department newsletter](http://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/newsletter), but this year was extra fun because I got to flex my infographic muscle by showcasing how well the department has done in 2019! Can't wait to do some fun timeline work for my final issue before graduating next year!
