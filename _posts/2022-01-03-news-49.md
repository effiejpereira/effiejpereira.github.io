Wonderful research news to start the year, with [Chapter 3 of my dissertation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35084707/) being published in Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics! In this chapter, I further probed whether the external factor of frequency may be responsible in preferential and spontaneous attentional biasing towards faces and eyes.
