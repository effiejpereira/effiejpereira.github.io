[Chapter 1 of my dissertation](https://rdcu.be/bfe4G) has finally been published in Psych Research! In the first line of my dissertation work, I investigated the prevailing notion that faces and eyes spontaneously bias attention, and across four studies (an additional three of which did not make it into the publication), I demonstrate the fragility of these systems within laboratory tasks. These findings really highlight that attention to social information is likely only engaged when it's relevant to our task, rather than being 'on' for faces all the time.

This paper has been years in the making given how difficult null findings are to publish but I'm really proud of how well this came together. With Chapter 2 being in R&R at the moment, let's see if I can go 4 for 4 at the plate this year!
