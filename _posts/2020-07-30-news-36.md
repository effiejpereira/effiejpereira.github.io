Had a great time working on the layout and graphics for [McGill Psychology Department's Virtual Poster Board](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/events-colloquia-0/undergraduate-research-day), to recognize all of our undergraduate thesis students this year who were not able to present in-person for Undergraduate Research Day. Although physical distancing might have kept us all apart, I'm glad we have this living online document of the tremendous work they all put in.
