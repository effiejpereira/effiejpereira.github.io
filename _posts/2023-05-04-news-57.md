The program brought together Tier 2 CRCs, Independent Indigenous Researchers, & Banting Postdoctoral Fellows to strengthen the connection between science & policy communities and learn about how scientific evidence is used for policy making in Parliament.<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp1.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp2.jpg'><br><br>
It was amazing to see the love for research and innovation at some of the highest levels of government, and I was thrilled to meet with Dr. Mona Nemer, Chief Science Advisor of Canada, Valerie Bradford, MP for Kitchener South-Hespeler, and numerous others. I cannot think of better people to champion the great scientific work we do here in Canada!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp3.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp4.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp5.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp6.jpg'><br><br>
A hearty thanks to everyone involved in organizing this phenomenal event and helping us build lasting connections with other diverse researchers and with parliamentarians and their staff. I'm excited to put my new scicomm and policy skills to work!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2023_05_smp7.jpg'><br><br>"
