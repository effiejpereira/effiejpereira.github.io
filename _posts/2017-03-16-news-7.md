It harkens back to one of my favourite quotes from Dr. Nancy Kanwisher:<br><br><i>'Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research by pointing out that it may help us someday to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism. That's a hugely important goal, and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it, but fixing things that are broken in the world is not the only thing that's worth doing.'</i><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2017_03_quote.jpg'><br><br>"
