A big thank you to Trevor Nace and Emily Spear, editors at Science Trends, who [featured my dissertation work as an article](https://sciencetrends.com/looking-at-versus-focusing-on-faces-what-attracts-our-attention/) on their platform. It's been great getting some press on this research showing that although spontaneous attention to faces may be less robust than we expected, it's also much more complex than we realized!
