It was my first year being on the SMP Organizing Committee this time around and I loved talking about my past experience in the program and getting to work behind the scenes to help researchers understand the pivotal part we play in Canada's policy-making landscape. SMP was easily the highlight of 2023 for me, and the fact that I can say that again this year is in no small part to the stellar team I get to work with who make this job immensely fun -- shout outs to this amazing crew and can't wait to grow the program with you all in the future!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2024_05_smp5.jpg'><br><br>"
