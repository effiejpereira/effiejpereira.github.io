Since the start of the year, I've been involved with [Simply Neuroscience](https://www.simplyneuroscience.org/), an international non-profit outreach society that empowers young students to get involved in the cognitive sciences through education, outreach, and awareness. As a Senior Academic Mentor with the _Action Potential Advising Program_, I've just been paired with 1 high school and 1 undergraduate student to introduce them to academia and research, and provide them with educational advice as they navigate their early career in the sciences.

Remembering how overwhelming academia can feel at the start of my career, it's great that I now have the opportunity to give back and be a mentor to others in the field!
