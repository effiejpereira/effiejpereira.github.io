I always love attending [CSBBCS](https://www.csbbcs.org/meetings-1) every year and seeing what my fellow Canadians are up to across the provinces. This year was also extra special since I was awarded Runner-Up for Best Oral Presentation for my talk showing that fluctuation patterns between attentional and mind wandering states are associated with differential life outcomes. This was the same talk that I won an award for at HBHL earlier this year and clearly there's something about this line of research that resonates with people!
