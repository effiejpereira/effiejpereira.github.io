excerpt: "Had a great time presenting my work on attentional selection of faces at <a href='http://www.visionsciences.org/' target='_blank'>VSS</a> in St. Pete Beach this past month. The more that I work the conference circuit and talk about our non-replication of the social attentional bias, the more I realize that others have had similar issues in mimicking this supposedly robust effect. It's great to have validation of our methods, but it's equally as astounding to think of the number of file-drawer studies that were prematurely retired because the original effects were thought to be robust across all conditions and tasks. Will be excited to hear the feedback we get on the paper once it's published!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2018_05_VSS.jpg'><br><br>"

Had a great time presenting my work on attentional selection of faces at [VSS](http://www.visionsciences.org/) in St. Pete Beach this past month. The more that I work the conference circuit and talk about our non-replication of the social attentional bias, the more I realize that others have had similar issues in mimicking this supposedly robust effect. It's great to have validation of our methods, but it's equally as astounding to think of the number of file-drawer studies that were prematurely retired because the original effects were thought to be robust across all conditions and tasks. Will be excited to hear the feedback we get on the paper once it's published!
