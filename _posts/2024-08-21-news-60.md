excerpt: "So thrilled to show off our official name and logo for the Queen's Attentional Dynamics Laboratory or the QuAD Lab for short. A big thank you to graphic designer Eric Brousseau for the mock up and can't wait to get the space up and running once construction is complete!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2024_08_quad.jpg'><br><br>
I'm also so excited with how well my office space has come together too. Between the purple walls and all the orphan plants I've been taking in, it's definitely become my cozy work spot this year. A big shout out to local Kingston artist <a href='https://littledaydreamer.ca/' target='_blank'>Little Daydreamer</a> for some great pixel art to help keep my head in the clouds!<br><br><img src='/images/posts/2024_08_pixel1.jpg'><br><br><img src='/images/posts/2024_08_pixel2.jpg'><br><br>"

I'm also so excited with how well my office space has come together too. Between the purple walls and all the orphan plants I've been taking in, it's definitely become my cozy work spot this year. A big shout out to local Kingston artist [Little Daydreamer](https://littledaydreamer.ca/) for some great pixel art to help keep my head in the clouds!
