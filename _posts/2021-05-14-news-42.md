Just finished a great three-day workshop from [CenterStat](https://centerstat.org/introduction-to-structural-equation-modeling/) as an Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling. Cannot recommend this course highly enough as Drs. Dan Bauer and Patrick Curran did a phenomenal job keeping everyone engaged and interested through the theoretical processing and linear algebra content, and I'm definitely excited for the rest of their statistical training line-up this summer!
