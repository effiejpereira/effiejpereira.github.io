I'm an NSERC postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo, working with Dr. Daniel Smilek in the Vision & Attention Laboratory.

My [research](/research/) investigates the **temporal dynamics of human cognition** â€“ in particular, I am interested in the ways that cognitive processes fluctuate over time and give rise to seemingly random variations in behaviour that are in fact quite predictable. Over the years, I have examined temporal dynamics in internal attention, in social attention, and in embedded attention.

Outside of academia, I'm a statistics nerd and an avid baseball fan, and am usually more than happy to chat for hours about either.
