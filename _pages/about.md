I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology at Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/) and my [research](/research/) investigates **attentional dynamics**, which captures how attentional processes ebb and flow over time to result in unique individual variability in performance and functioning, thereby allowing me to differentiate your attention from mine. To explore this, I use behavioural experiments (e.g., attentional tasks, experience sampling, collaborative activities), psychophysiological methods (e.g., eye tracking, EEG, fMRI), and computational approaches (e.g., nonlinear analyses, machine learning) to uncover attentional dynamics in social situations, across internal thoughts, and within digital environments.

Outside of academia, I'm a statistics nerd and an avid baseball fan, and am usually more than happy to chat for hours about either.

**For Fall 2025, I'll be reviewing graduate applications in the Cognitive Neuroscience and Social-Personality area for students interested in exploring attentional dynamics. Feel free to review [Queen's Psychology's general application guidelines](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/graduate-program/prospective-students/thinking-coming-queens-psychology) and [my own Prospective Students page](/students/).**
