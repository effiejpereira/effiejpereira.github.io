I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology at Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/) and my [research](/research/) investigates the **temporal dynamics of human cognition**, which primarily concerns how our cognitive processes fluctuate over time. These fluctuations give rise to seemingly random variations in behaviour, which my work is finding to be quite predictable and structured. Over the years, I have studied temporal dynamics when attending to others, when attending to ourselves, and when attending to our environment.

Outside of academia, I'm a statistics nerd and an avid baseball fan, and am usually more than happy to chat for hours about either.
