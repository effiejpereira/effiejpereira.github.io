This section contains important information for prospective students interested in working with me and joining the Queen's Attentional Dynamics lab. For Fall 2025, I'll be reviewing graduate applications in the Cognitive Neuroscience and Social-Personality area for students interested in exploring attentional dynamics. Feel free to review [Queen's Psychology's general application guidelines](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/graduate-program/prospective-students/thinking-coming-queens-psychology) and the information contained on this page, and reach out over email to say hi!

### Q: Why does this page exist?
_This collection of questions and answers has been created because graduate application processes are a highly uneven playing field, given that a lack of mentorship and professional connections often leads to a lack of access to information. I firmly believe that no one should be left behind simply because they did not have any guidance on the application process. So this page draws inspiration from colleagues who have crafted similar documents and will hopefully be one small way of levelling the playing field for all._


### Q: What are you looking for in a graduate student?
_First and foremost, it's passion. I find passion and enthusiam to be the biggest driver of excitement in academia, and if you have a passion for science, a passion for research, a passion for stats, or a passion for coding, you'll likely be a good fit for working in my lab._
_Second, I look for persistence. I think many people in academia are naturally curious because we like learning about new topics, new methods, and new questions. But in order to learn these things, we need to be okay with failing a lot because there’s lots that we don’t know and that we'll mess up along the way to knowing. For this reason, recovering from these failures is so critical since it means being open to learning more, being open to fixing mistakes, being open to feedback, and being persistent despite struggling._
_Third, I look for an alignment with my research interests, such that you care about attention and are interested in how it functions and how it moves over time. Though I'm happy to consider co-supervision with experts in other areas, attention in all its facets will always be my bread and butter._
_Finally, I'm a stickler for details. I aim to do things effectively and thoroughly, as I think thorough work creates the best science, fosters the most learning, and gives you the most skills. This translates to recruiting students who like detailing their work and progress for future use, using code or programming when cleaning data and running analyses, and working through their writing so that the science that makes sense in their mind also makes sense to others._


### Q: Should I email you to express interest in working with you?
_You do not need to email me just to let me know you’re applying to my lab. I know how stressful these emails can be to send, and it won’t have an impact on how I review your application, so feel free to save yourself the stress. However, if you have questions that would determine whether you’d like to apply and that weren’t answered elsewhere on my website, feel free to reach out to me and/or my current or former students._


### Q: What is your mentorship style?
_My mentorship style is based on my own experiences with past mentors, and as such, it's still evolving as I learn how best to support the diversity of my students. My current approach is to be a personal scaffold as you work through your career. What this means is that I’ll work with you to figure out what you want and help you identify both short-term and long-term goals that will help get you there. Once we know these goals, my aim is to offer you guidance and room to try, fail, and succeed. My ultimate goal is to figuratively work myself out of a job and get you to the point where you feel confident as an independent researcher and scholar._

_What this means practically is that I like to establish clear and collaborative goals for your research and professional development early in training. Doing so means that I can best support your individual development through one-on-one mentorship that ensures that you are on track to achieve your goals. Regular meetings with me and weekly meetings with the lab are a given to help foster critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Through this independent and team-based work, you will learn conceptual co-creation skills surrounding: (1) qualitative and quantitative understanding of research literature; (2) developing, designing, and programming experiments; (3) collecting and analyzing data; (4) reporting research findings through scientific presentations and public lectures; and (5) writing grants and research papers for specialized and general audiences. As a result, during your time with me and with the QuAD lab, you will gain a mastery of cutting-edge technical skills that include: (6) learning how to program in Python, Javascript, R, and MATLAB; (7) working with big data, along with the high-level computational analyses that accompany these complex datasets; (8) operating and collecting gaze data via eye tracking systems; (9) operating and collecting electrophysiological activity via EEG systems; and (10) operating and collecting neuroimaging data via MRI scanning. These marketable skills should have you well prepared for the next stage of your career, whether that be in academia, industry, healthcare, or government sectors._

_Though this is a brief preview of what it would be like to work with me, my current and former students are truly the best source for this information. All the individuals listed in the QuAD lab have consented for potential applicants to contact them with questions and I genuinely encourage you to reach out to them before or during the application process._


### Q: What is your perspective on equity, diversity & inclusion (EDI)?
_My own philosophy on EDI has been shaped by my experiences as a woman, an immigrant, a first-generation scholar, a member of a visible minority group, and a member of the 2SLGBTQ+ community. These backgrounds have afforded me a unique perspective on the challenges and barriers that exist for scholars of historically excluded groups, and it fuels my motivation to address these challenges and barriers to ensure that future generations of scholars have the necessary supports to thrive within academia._

_As such, my philosophy on EDI involves identifying and eliminating obstacles in recruitment, development, and retention that hinder equitable membership in the sciences, with the aim of permitting broader applicant pools to have access to and success within academia. I believe that EDI efforts benefit the entire field of psychological science, and I am committed to ensuring that I'm always learning and practicing how to be the best ally I can be._
