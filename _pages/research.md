> "Our mental life, like a bird's life, seems to be made of an alternation of flights and perchings."
> --- William James, On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology (1884)

Over the decades, much of our work on cognitive mechanisms has been directed by Jamesâ€™ notion of perchings and flights. For example, within attention, we know a considerable deal about how our minds stay perched and focused on a task, an individual, or a goal, and we are discovering what it means to have our minds fly away into our internal mental landscape or onto other external objectives. However, there has been considerably less focus given to what our patterns of alternation and fluctuations represent.

My research program focuses on exploring the ebbs and flows in cognitive processes over time to better understand the **temporal dynamics of human cognition**. Using converging behavioural, computational, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging approaches, I have created three unique lines of research that uncover temporal dynamics in: (1) internal attention, (2) social attention, and (3) embedded attention.



## Temporal Dynamics in Internal Attention

When attention is not fully engaged on our external environment, attentional processes can fluctuate and turn towards internal states, through mind wandering and mental simulation. These transient states account for 30-50% of our waking lives and they have a large impact on behaviour, both negative and positive. For example, mind wandering is linked to negative outcomes in learning, comprehension, and mood, as well as positive outcomes in creativity, decision-making, and social problem solving. To date, **we do not have a clear understanding of how states of internal attention result in vastly differential impacts**.

In my work, I have characterized temporal fluctuations between attentive and mind wandering states _(i)_ within individuals, _(ii)_ across tasks and motivation, and _(iii)_ within neural mechanisms to uncover the effect of these temporal patterns on real life outcomes. To date, I have found that each individual has stable and predictable temporal patterns of internal attention that can be linked to distinct negative and positive outcomes in behaviour.

## Temporal Dynamics in Social Attention

When attention is engaged on our immediate environment, people and faces are perhaps the most important sources of information we encounter in our social world. For this reason, attention to social information is functionally distinct and highly prioritized over attention to non-social sources. However, despite the importance of social information, **we do not have a thorough understanding of the factors that impact temporal fluctuations in social attention across differing levels of interaction**.

In my work, I have examined the factors that impact social attention on a moment-to-moment basis _(i)_ across behavioural data, _(ii)_ within eye tracking metrics, _(iii)_ in electrophysiological states, and _(iv)_ across real-life interactions. To date, I have uncovered that temporal stability in social attention is highly impacted by visual features and contextual settings, which both play a large role in determining the degree to which these effects occurs as an early or late process.

## Temporal Dynamics in Embedded Attention

When studying attention in ecological environments, there is a strong collaboration across external perception, internal goals, emotional states, and memory stores that impact both short- and long-term attentional effects. Therefore, **it is critical to situate temporal dynamics of attention within an embedded framework to understand its interaction across these multidimensional processes**.

In my work, I have investigated how temporal dynamics of attention vary within _(i)_ natural environments, _(ii)_ the real world, and _(iii)_ the digital world. To date, I have discovered that attentional fluctuations dynamically evolve based on the experiential and effortful nature of our environment.
