> "Our mental life, like a bird's life, seems to be made of an alternation of flights and perchings."
> --- William James, On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology (1884)

Over the decades, much of our work on attention has been directed by Jamesâ€™ notion of perchings and flights. For example, we know a considerable deal about how our minds stay perched and focused on an individual, a task, or a goal, and we're discovering what it means to have our minds fly away to other external objectives or to our internal mental landscape. However, there has been considerably less focus given to what our patterns of alternation represent.

My research program focuses on the understudied ebbs and flows and fluctuations in attentional processes over time, known as **attentional dynamics**. By bridging complex computational approaches with behavioural, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging methods, I explore attentional dynamics (1) in social situations, (2) across internal thoughts, and (3) within digital environments.



## Attentional Dynamics in Social Situations

When attention is engaged on our external environment, people and faces are perhaps the most important information that we encounter in our inherently social world. Prior work has found that attention to social vs. non-social information is highly stable and robustly prioritized over time; however, **it is unclear whether attentional dynamics in social situations are dependent on the value we ascribe to people and faces**.

In my work, I have examined the factors that impact social attention on a moment-to-moment basis _(i)_ across behavioural data, _(ii)_ within eye tracking metrics, _(iii)_ in electrophysiological states, and _(iv)_ across real-life interactions. To date, I have uncovered that attentional stability in social situations is highly impacted by featural and functional utility, which both play a large role in determining the degree to which these effects occurs as an initial or long-term process.

## Attentional Dynamics across Internal Thoughts
------

When attention is not fully engaged on our external environment, attentional processes fluctuate and turn towards internal states through mind wandering and mental simulation. These states account for 30-50% of our waking lives and they have a large impact on behaviour, both negative (e.g., detriments to learning and mood) and positive (e.g., benefits to creativity and decision-making). However, **we do not have a clear understanding of how attentional dynamics across internal thoughts contribute to these different impacts**.

In my work, I have quantified attentional dynamics between external and internal states _(i)_ within individuals, _(ii)_ across tasks and traits, and _(iii)_ within neural mechanisms to uncover the effect of these patterns on real life outcomes. To date, I have found that each individual has stable and predictable patterns of internal thoughts that can be linked to distinct negative and positive outcomes in behaviour.

## Attentional Dynamics within Digital Environments
------

When attention is studied in controlled laboratory environments, we lose the rich diversity of attentional dynamics found within real and digital contexts. For this reason, **it is critical to craft powerful tools that can uncover attentional dynamics across these various settings**.

In my work, I have developed a temporal experience sampling smartphone application (TESSA), a video teleconferencing platform (VICTOR), and a message communication platform (MECO) to craft novel investigations on how attentional dynamics vary within _(i)_ natural environments and _(ii)_ the digital world. To date, I have uncovered that attentional fluctuations dynamically evolve based on the experiential and effortful nature of our environment.
