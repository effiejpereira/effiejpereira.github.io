> "Our mental life, like a bird's life, seems to be made of an alternation of flights and perchings."
> --- William James, On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology (1884)

Over the decades, much of our work on cognitive mechanisms has been directed by Jamesâ€™ notion of perchings and flights. For example, within attention, we know a considerable deal about how our minds stay perched and focused on a task or goal, and we are discovering what it means to have our minds fly away from our task and wander through our internal mental landscape. However, considerably less focus has been given to what our patterns of alternations represent, and the notion that individuals may have consistent and predictable ebbs and flows in cognitive processes over time.

As such, my research program looks at **temporal dynamics in human cognition**, with a particular focus on uncovering stable and fluctuating patterns of attention over time. Using converging behavioural, computational, and physiological approaches, I am conducting three related lines of research investigating temporal dynamics in: (1) social attention, (2) internal attention, and (3) embedded attention.



## Temporal Dynamics in Social Attention

When attention is engaged on our immediate environment, people and faces are perhaps the most important sources of information we encounter in our inherently social world. For this reason, attention to social information is functionally distinct and is found to be highly prioritized over attention to non-social sources. However, despite the importance of social information, **we do not have a thorough understanding of the temporal nature of social attention and how this behaviour varies across higher levels of interaction**.

In my work, I have examined the factors that impact social attention on a moment-to-moment basis _(i)_ across behavioural data, _(ii)_ within eye tracking data, _(iii)_ in electrophysiological states, and _(iv)_ across real-life and simulated interactions. To date, I have uncovered that social attention is a lot more fleeting than we once realized and that task-based and contextual factors play a large role in determining the degree to which this effect occurs as an early or late process.

## Temporal Dynamics in Internal Attention

When attentional processes are not fully engaged on our external environment, attention can fluctuate and turn towards internal states, through mind wandering and mental simulation. These transient states account for 30-50% of our waking lives, and they have a large impact on behaviour, both negative and positive. For example, mind wandering is linked to negative outcomes in learning, comprehension, and mood, as well as positive outcomes in creativity, decision-making, and social problem solving. To date, **we do not have a clear understanding of how internal states of attention result in vastly differential impacts**.

In my work, I have characterized temporal fluctuations between attentive and mind wandering states _(i)_ within individuals, _(ii)_ across tasks and motivation, and _(iii)_ within neural mechanisms to uncover the effect of temporal patterns on real life outcomes. To date, I have found that each individual has consistent repetitive patterns of mind wandering that can be linked to distinct positive and negative outcomes in behaviour.

## Temporal Dynamics in Embedded Attention

When studying attention within ecological contexts, there is a strong interaction across external perception, internal goals, emotional states, and memorial stores that impact both short- and long-term attentional effects. Therefore, to understand attention across these multidimensional processes, **it is critical to situate temporal dynamics of attention within an embedded framework that encompasses daily life settings**.

In my work, I have investigated how temporal dynamics of attention vary within _(i)_ the real world and _(ii)_ the digital world. To date, I have discovered that attentional fluctuations dynamically evolve based on the experiential nature of environmenal settings and daily activites, and on decisional elements that capture the perceived benefits and costs of engaging attention on various tasks.
